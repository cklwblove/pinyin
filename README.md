# Pinyin

Simple Chinese conversion to pinyin library.

### Usage

```bash
npm install @liwb/pinyin

or 
# Run npm install and write your library name when asked. That's all!
yarn add @liwb/pinyin
```

### Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import pinyin from '@liwb/pinyin'
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/lib` in case you have a modular library:

```javascript
import something from 'mylib/dist/lib/something'
```
